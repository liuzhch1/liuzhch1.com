I had a dream about you this morning

I sent you messages and we met in a supermarket

You smiled at me and then turned around

Again you turned to me with tears on your face

We interlocked fingers and walked away

Will you love me even I am not that good

YES for three thousand in my heart

We sat down on the bench

Talked a lot about our past

I was happy we were together again

What happened next?

I woke up.
